This is a simple Sinatra application used to demonstrate shared web credentials
with iOS applications.

See the [official documentation](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Security/Reference/SharedWebCredentialsRef/) for more information.

Deploy this to [Heroku](http://heroku.com) and use their free SSL to try it out.  You'll need to add an `apple-app-site-association`
response with your app id to make it work.
